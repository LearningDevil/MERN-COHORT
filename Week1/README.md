# Week 1 – JavaScript Basics

Welcome to **Week 1** of the MERN cohort

This week focuses on building a strong foundation in **JavaScript**, one of the core technologies in the MERN stack. We are focusing on both **hands-on coding** and **conceptual understanding**.

---

## 📌 Goals This Week

- Understand and apply JavaScript fundamentals
- Practice writing basic JS scripts and solving small problems
- Learn about control flow, loops, arrays, functions, and objects
- Start building the habit of maintaining **clean and readable code**

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Refer to [`theory.md`](./theory.md) for a detailed list of topics and concepts such as:
- Variables & Data Types
- Loops & Conditionals
- Functions
- Arrays and Objects
- DOM basics (if introduced)

---

## 📂 js-foundation Highlights

In the `js-foundation` directory, you'll find:
- Code snippets written during practice
- Exploratory programs (e.g., reversing arrays, Object clerification)
- Incremental learning of logic-building and debugging

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Visual Studio Code** for development
- **Node.js** for executing JavaScript in the terminal
- **Console** for basic I/O and debugging

---

## 🧾 Notes

- All scripts are written using **plain JavaScript**.
- Code readability and experimentation are encouraged.
- Open to edits and improvements as learning continues!
