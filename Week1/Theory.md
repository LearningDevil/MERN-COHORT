## Theory:
### 1. JavaScript Foundation
**JS is an Interpreted lang.**
 - Means it goes line by line while executing, partially run code until an error encounter.

**Why JS is better than other lang.**
 - Browsers can only understand HTML/CSS/JS (Not technically true)
 - Node.js -> Enables JS to be used for "Backend Development" as well.

**Strict VS Dynamic Langs.**

**Single Threaded nature of JS**
 - JS uses strictly 1 core of your machine at a time.
 - That's why it considered to be a bad lang. for scalable systems.
  **There is a way to make it use all cores of your machine.**

**Simple Primitive**
 - variables > let, var, const
 - DataTypes > Strings, Numbers, booleans
 - if/else
 - Loops-For loops 
  **Generally, we use "let" and "const" >> that's when we need a variable that can change it's type or dynamic in nature then use "let", whereas "const" is used when variable needs to be fixed.**

**Arrays & Objects**

**Function**
   - Let's us abstract out logic in your prog.
   - Think of them as independent part of the prog. that works when needed(called), it takes input and provide the respective output value.
   **Concept of callbacks**
      - eg. function xyz(n1, n2, fnToCall){}
