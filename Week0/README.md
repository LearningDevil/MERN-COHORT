# Week 0 - Zerodha Landing Page (Warm-up Project)

## Overview

This project was part of my Week 0 warm-up exercise, where I practiced basic HTML and CSS.  
The goal was to get comfortable with structuring a webpage and applying simple styles.

As a practice task, I recreated a very basic version of the Zerodha landing page.
